## Problem

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [$-2^{31}$, $2^{31} - 1$], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

*Constraints*

$- 2^{31} \le x \le 2^{31} - 1$

## Examples

```
Input: x = 123
Output: 321
```

```
Input: x = -123
Output: -321
```

```
Input: x = 120
Output: 21
```
