## 673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence/

Given an integer array nums, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.

Notice that the sequence has to be strictly increasing.


*Constraints*

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2000`
- `-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`

## Examples

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
```

```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
```
